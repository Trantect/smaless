            | Get the lowdown on the key pieces of Bootstrap's infrastructure, including our approach to better, faster, stronger web development.
         h2#overview-doctype HTML5 doctype
         p
            | Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects.
         h2#overview-mobile Mobile first
         p
            | With Bootstrap 2, we added optional mobile friendly styles for key aspects of the framework. With Bootstrap 3, we've rewritten the project to be mobile friendly from the start. Instead of adding on optional mobile styles, they're baked right into the core. In fact,
            strong Bootstrap is mobile first
            | . Mobile first styles can be found throughout the entire library instead of in separate files.
         p
            | To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming,
            strong add the viewport meta tag
            |  to your
            code <head>
            | .
         meta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1')
         p
            | You can disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding
            code user-scalable=no
            |  to the viewport meta tag. This disables zooming, meaning users are only able to scroll, and results in your site feeling a bit more like a native application. Overall, we don't recommend this on every site, so use caution!
         meta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no')
         h2#overview-type-links Typography and links
         p
            | Bootstrap sets basic global display, typography, and link styles. Specifically, we:
         ul
            li
               | Set
               code background-color: #fff;
               |  on the
               code body
            li
               | Use the
               code @font-family-base
               | ,
               code @font-size-base
               | , and
               code @line-height-base
               |  attributes as our typographic base
            li
               | Set the global link color via
               code @link-color
               |  and apply link underlines only on
               code :hover
         p
            | These styles can be found within
            code scaffolding.less
            | .
         h2#overview-normalize Normalize.css
         p
            | For improved cross-browser rendering, we use
            a(href='http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/', target='_blank') Normalize.css
            | , a project by
            a(href='https://twitter.com/necolas', target='_blank') Nicolas Gallagher
            |  and
            a(href='https://twitter.com/jon_neal', target='_blank') Jonathan Neal
            | .
         h2#overview-container Containers
         p
            | Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your projects. Note that, due to
            code padding
            |  and more, neither container is nestable.
         p
            | Use
            code .container
            |  for a responsive fixed width container.
         .container
            | ...
         p
            | Use
            code .container-fluid
            |  for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.
         .container-fluid
            | ...
